# Portfolio - Ada Kłoś

*Having a masters’ degree in bacterial genetics, I draw from my experience in biological research when working on Data Science projects. I see a great similarity between the scientific method used in natural sciences (such as data observation, forming research problems, stating hypotheses, conducting experiments, analyzing results, forming conclusions etc.) and various aspects of machine learning.
I constantly strive to perfect my skills in data analysis, visualization and modeling as well as programming, machine learning and statistics.*

## Project 1: [Credit Card Eligibility](https://github.com/adaklos/Credit_Card_Eligibility)

### **About the project**


*The goal was to create model capable of establishing if client applying for creadit card is credible or not. 
Prediction were based on Default Payments of Credit Card Clients in Taiwan from 2005 dataset.*

*Project consist of data cleaning, exploaratory data analysis, data preparation for machine learning algorithms, modeling, models evaluation and final conclusions.*


**Libraries used:** 
*  *pandas*
* *numpy*
* *matplotlib.pyplot*
* *seaborn*
* *sklearn*

**Techniques used:** 
* *binary classification modeling*
* *grid search* 
* *stratify shuffle split*
* *recursive feature elimination*
* *piepelines*
* *one hot encoder*

## Project 2: [Of Genomes And Genetics](https://github.com/adaklos/Of_Genomes_And_Genetics)


### **About the project**


*The project is based on* [HackerEarth Machine Learning Challenge](https://www.hackerearth.com/challenges/competitive/hackerearth-machine-learning-challenge-genetic-testing/).
*The task was to precit genetics disorder and disorder subclass based on medical information about children who suffer from genetic disorders.*

*The big part of the project was data cleaning and supplementation. There was also conducted exploaratory data analysis. Few models were trained and some problems with dataset were revealed.*


**Libraries used:** 
*  *pandas*
* *numpy*
* *matplotlib.pyplot*
* *seaborn*
* *sklearn*

**Techniques used:** 
* *multiple classification modeling*
* *grid search* 
* *train test split*
* *principal component analysis*
* *piepelines*
* *one hot encoder*
